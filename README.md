Now with leviathans that make the world come alive! Did not include every single reaper
spawn in order to reduce computations.

## Attributions

I used the following model for the Aurora made by **Pixel Meteor**:

**Changes**:

I increased the roughness and painted over the afterburn on the engines.

## Heightmap Source

A lot of the map was based on the heightmaps I got here:

## Run Locally

Clone repo. In cmd/terminal go to the folder and run:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then you can open a browser and launch the map at:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```
